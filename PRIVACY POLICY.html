    <h1>Privacy Policy for NORMAN Athlete Tracker</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: October 24, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> NORMAN stores all data locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share any of your personal information with third parties. Your data stays on your computer.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>NORMAN Athlete Tracker ("we," "our," or "the extension") is a Chrome browser extension designed to help coaches and recruiters track and analyze athlete performance data from publicly available meet results pages.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>To provide our core functionality, NORMAN collects and processes the following types of data <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:</p>

    <h3>2.1 Location Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> Your approximate location (city/region) may be used to determine your time zone for displaying athlete information accurately.</li>
        <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> Location data is only used within the extension to provide regional context for meet results.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Stored locally using Chrome's storage API. Never transmitted to external servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Web History (Browsing Activity on Sports Results Pages)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> When you visit athletic results pages (such as athletic.net, milesplit.com, or similar sites), NORMAN reads the page content to identify athlete names and performance data.</li>
        <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> This data is used solely to scan for athlete information and populate your local database.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Page titles and URLs you scan are stored locally to help you track which meets you've reviewed. This data never leaves your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 User Activity</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> Click events, text selections, and interactions within athletic results pages.</li>
        <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> User interactions (such as highlighting an athlete's name or clicking "scan page") trigger NORMAN to extract athlete data from the current page.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Activity logs are stored locally to maintain your athlete list, recruitment notes, and tracked athletes. No activity data is transmitted externally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data collected by NORMAN is stored locally on your device using:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chrome Storage API:</strong> Athlete databases, notes, and settings</li>
        <li><strong>Local Browser Storage:</strong> User preferences and cached data</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> No data is transmitted to external servers, cloud services, or third parties at any time.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>We do not:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell or transfer your data to third parties</li>
            <li>Share your data with advertisers or data brokers</li>
            <li>Transmit your data to external servers</li>
            <li>Use your data for purposes unrelated to athlete tracking and recruitment</li>
            <li>Use your data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Single Purpose</h2>
    <p>NORMAN is designed for a single purpose: <strong>to help coaches and recruiters track, analyze, and manage athlete recruitment information from publicly available meet results.</strong></p>
    <p>All data collection and processing is directly related to this core functionality. We do not use your data for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>View your data:</strong> All stored data is visible within the extension interface</li>
        <li><strong>Delete specific data:</strong> Remove individual athletes, notes, or entries at any time</li>
        <li><strong>Delete all data:</strong> Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored data</li>
        <li><strong>Export your data:</strong> Export your athlete database to CSV format for backup purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keeping your browser and operating system updated</li>
        <li>Using strong passwords to protect your device</li>
        <li>Being cautious when sharing your device with others</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>NORMAN is designed for use by coaches, recruiters, and athletic professionals. The extension does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. Athlete information processed by the extension is derived from publicly available meet results.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Because all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your information:</p>
    <ul>
